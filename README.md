## üì• Installing and Opening UABEA

<details>
  <summary><b>UABEA Instructions</b></summary>

1. **Install UABEA**:
   - Visit the official UABEA repository on GitHub:  
     [UABEA GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA)
   - Download the latest version, extract the files to an accessible location, and run the `UABEAvalonia.exe` program.

2. **Open the `data.unity3d` file**:
   - In UABEA, click **File > Open** and select the `data.unity3d` file you want to modify (this file is located in the decompiled APK directory:  
     `Apk Easy Tool\1-Decompiled APKs\DECOMPILED_APK_NAME\assets\bin\Data`).
   - This file contains all compressed data, such as textures, assets, audio, and animations from the game.

3. **Extract the file**:
   - Click **File** to extract the contents and choose a location on your computer to save the extracted `data.unity3d` file. Then, click **Export all** to extract the bundles inside the file, such as `resources.assets`. (Avoid opening the file directly in memory, as this may result in data loss if the application crashes.)

4. **Opening the extracted `data.unity3d` file**:  
   - After extracting `data.unity3d` and its bundles, close UABEA and reopen the program. Then, open the `Extracted DataUnity3D` file.  
   - After loading the file, click the selection tab and choose the **`resources.assets`** bundle to continue editing.

## üìÇ Managing Files with UABEA

<details>
  <summary><b>Managing Files with UABEA</b></summary>

1. **Focus only on the `resources.assets` bundle** (as it contains all the necessary information for meaningful translations and changes):
   - Navigate to the `resources.assets` bundle and click **Info** to open the file viewer window.

2. **Searching for files by name**
   - Searching for files by name can be tricky, as the search will only work if you use the exact name of the file you're looking for.  
   - Use the direction options to assist in the search, as if the file is at the top and you search at the bottom, UABEA might not find it.

3. **Apply a view filter**:
   - Go to the **View** tab and apply a filter to make file searching easier.  
   - Focus on the following file formats:
     - **TextAsset**: Contains Almanac data and `Plant_Data`.
     - **Texture2D**: Contains game interface textures, plants, etc.
     - **MonoBehaviour**: Contains game interface text and data. Focus only on files like `Text`, `TextMeshPro`, `TextMeshProUGUI`, and `TMP_InputField` as they contain translation information.
     - **Font**: Contains all fonts used in the game.

1. **Saving `resources.assets`**  
   - After making all desired changes to `resources.assets`, click **File > Save**.

2. **Saving in the bundle manager**  
   - Return to the bundle manager window.

3. **Compressing the `data.unity3d` file**  
   - After saving, click **File > Compress**.  
   - An Explorer window will open, where you should select the **original `data.unity3d` file (not extracted)**, located inside the decompiled APK folder where you're making modifications.

4. **Finalizing**

## üìÉ Handling MonoBehaviour with Il2CppDumper

<details>
  <summary><b>MonoBehaviour with Il2CppDumper</b></summary>

When the game is compiled with **Il2Cpp**, the **MonoBehaviour** data is compressed and unreadable in the `resources.assets` file. To resolve this, **Il2CppDumper** is required.

1. **How to Use Il2CppDumper**:
   - Download **Il2CppDumper**: [GitHub Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper)
   - Provide the `libil2cpp.so` and `global-metadata.dat` files to **Il2CppDumper**.  
   - After the dump process, the program will create a folder named `DummyDll` in your directory.

2. **Configuring UABEA with Il2CppDumper**:
   - Copy the `DummyDll` folder to the same location as the extracted files.
   - Rename the folder to **Managed**.
   - Restart UABEA to ensure the "MonoBehaviour" files are read correctly.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Editing Text Content

<details>
  <summary><b>Editing Text Content</b></summary>

1. **How to Export and Import Text Files**:
   - Use the **Export dump** and **Import dump** features in UABEA to modify text files (you can also edit text directly in UABEA using the Edit Data function).
   - The text is located in files like `Text`, `TextMeshPro`, `TextMeshProUGUI`, and `TMP_InputField` as mentioned earlier.

2. **Editing Game Text**:
   - Some game text is located in MonoBehaviours, and to translate it, you'll need to manually check each file (Text, TextMeshPro, TextMeshProUGUI, and TMP_InputField). Since the text is disorganized, this task can be tedious. Additionally, many files will contain only numbers (usually plant sun costs) or be empty, and these can be ignored. Good luck editing! üöÄ

3. **Editing Other Game Text**:
   - Textual information, such as Odyssey bonuses, game text, level introductions, etc., is located in the `global-metadata.dat` file. You can edit it using the `MetaDataStringEditor` (available only in Mandarin).

## üñºÔ∏è Changing Textures

<details>
<summary><b>Instructions for Changing Textures</b></summary>

1. **How to Filter**:
  - To make searching for textures easier, filter by "Texture2D". Click **"View"**, then **"Filter"**, and select **"Deselect All"**. Then, check only **"Texture2D"**. This will display only textures.
  
2. **Searching for a Specific Texture**:
  - To quickly find the texture you want to modify, click **"View"**, then **"Search by Name"**. Enter the exact name of the texture you're looking for. Example: `SeedChooser_Background`.
  
3. **Changing Search Direction**:
  - If you don't find the desired texture, try changing the search direction using the **"Up"** and **"Down"** arrows.

4. **Modifying the Texture**:
  - After locating the texture, select it and click **"Plugins"** > **"Edit Texture"** > **"Load"**. Choose the modified texture and then click **"Save"** to save the changes.

<sub>If you'd like, you can download a file containing all the game textures with their respective names [**Click here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12CUC7Lty_KELPHn2RGYabdaqpEA3GhY1/view?usp=sharing).</sub>

## üñáÔ∏è Editing Remaining Text Content with MetaDataStringEditor

<details>
  <summary><b>Editing Remaining Text Content with MetaDataStringEditor</b></summary>

  ### 1. How to Use MetaDataStringEditor:
   - Download **MetaDataStringEditor**: [GitHub MetaDataStringEditor](https://github.com/JeremieCHN/MetaDataStringEditor/releases/tag/0.0) <sub><sub>(Available only in Mandarin)</sub></sub>
   - Download the `global-metadata` located at the top of this tutorial, or use the `global-metadata` located in the folder:
     ```
     Apk Easy Tool\1-Decompiled APKs\DECOMPILED_APK_NAME\assets\bin\Data\Managed\Metadata
     ```
     But **make a backup** before editing.
   
   - The MetaDataStringEditor interface is in Mandarin. Here's an image showing the translation of each button (in English):  
     ![English Buttons](https://i.imgur.com/X1gITCi.png)
  
   - **Be very careful** not to click "Close File". If you close it, you **will lose all your progress**.
   
   - The strings start appearing further down in the file.  
     ![This is where the strings are](https://i.imgur.com/AQ1RjXd.png)
  
   - **Warning**: MetaDataStringEditor can only handle Mandarin (Chinese) strings well. After making changes, saving, and reopening the file, you'll see strange text. However, you can still edit them normally if you know what each text represents; Whenever there 
        is a line break command like \n, manually insert a line break.
